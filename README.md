KZStats is a website that presents [Counter-Strike: Global Offensive](https://blog.counter-strike.net/) [KZ Mod](https://forum.gokz.org/) records and other related data.
This is the 3.0 GlobalAPI rework repo, currently under development.
I will publish the legacy repo for viewing soon.

### Contributing/Running the environment

Currently there are a few things such as manually created database tables etc. that make cloning and running the environment a bit tricky.
I will take the time to ensure the repo is clonable and runnable at some point as well as write some basic instructions.

However, if you view the code and see any potential improvements, mistakes or suggestions feel free to open a pull request.
