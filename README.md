KZStats is a website that presents [Counter-Strike: Global Offensive](https://blog.counter-strike.net/) [KZ Mod](https://forum.gokz.org/) records and other related data. This is the 3.0 GlobalAPI rework repo, currently in production.

**Note:** This was my first React + Tailwind project so most of the frontend code is pretty messy, I might clean it up at some point.

### Feature requests

For feature requests, message me on Discord (so0le#2553) and/or open an issue on GitHub.

### Contributing/Running the environment

Currently there are a few things such as manually created database tables etc. that make cloning and running the environment a bit tricky.
However, if you view the code and see any potential improvements, mistakes or suggestions feel free to open an issue or pull request.
